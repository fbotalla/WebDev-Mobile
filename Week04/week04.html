            <h3>Forms</h3>
            Forms are an essential components of most webpages. This is especially true when user input and data is required in order
            for the web page to function. Typically forms are composed of buttons, text, inputs and other components.
            When a form is submitted it is sent to the server to be process. JavaScript has the ability in intercept the form submitted
            and work with it before it is sent to the server side.
            With JavaScript we typically want to valid a form on the client side before it goes to the server. This becomes simple
            with events. In JavaScript we can listen for specifc events and do something when does events are triggered.
            These events conist of but not limited to: click events, mouse movements event, text change and so on.
            Below is a simple example of a form:
        <pre>
            &lt;form&gt;
                &lt;label for="fname"&gt;First name:&lt;/label&gt;
                &lt;input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"&gt;
                &lt;label for="lname"&gt;Last name:&lt;/label&gt;
                &lt;input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
        </pre>

            <h3>Object Oriented Prgramming</h3>
            As a premise, JavaScript is not based on OOP like other languages such as Java or C++. The rule and principle of OOP are applicable
            to JavaScript classes and object as well. Everything is JavaScript is an Object. There we have to learn to work with
            inhertitance and instances. 
            To make it simple, OOP is the idea that everything is an object (like in real life) and these object have properties and
            can do something. 

            An exemple of an Object is this:

            <Pre>
                class Human {
                    constructor(name,lastName,gender){
                        this.name = name;
                        this.gender = gender;
                        let lastName;
                        this.setLastName = lastName =>{return this.lastName = lastName};
                        this.getLastname = () => this.lastName;
                    }
                    canWalk(){
                        return true;
                    }
                    isAsleep(){
                        return false
                    }
                    canSpeak(){
                        return 'Hi I am ${this.name}'
                    }
                }
            </Pre>

            Object or classes become very useful when we need to use multiple of them throughout multiple areas of the code.
            To initialize an object we do the following:

            <pre>const frank = new Human('Frank','Doe','Male')</pre>

            From this <pre>frank</pre> object we can then call the various functions that have been declared in the <pre>Human</pre> class.
            I am currently working on a React Native project which is a framework to React which in return is a library to JavaScript.
            React utilizes this idea of OOP. It is comes in a different format, but the idea behind it is very similar. 

            <h3>Modules</h3>
            Similarly to other languages such as Java or C++ whose core is OOP, JavaScript can also utilize the same OOP programming.
            In Java or C++ we typically have a variety of files which represent the different classes. We can then import these objects
            into other files. These creates a simple to read and easy to navigate envirnment. In JavaScript we can also do this with Modules.
            We can export single functions or entire classes and then import them where we will use them in coordination with other .js files.

            Here is an example of how to export:
            
            <pre>export default Human</pre>

            to import in a differet .jf file we can do the following:

            <pre>import Human from 'pathToJSFile' </pre>

        </p>
