            <h3>This</h3>
            Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is progrmaming concerning real world things, actions and situations.
            Often times OOP takes much preprations and good architecture to establish well defined entities.
            An example of a OOP might be:

            <pre>
                dog = {
                    //Methods
                    const canBark: ()=>{
                        return 'Bark'
                    }
                    const isAsleep: ()=>{
                        return true;
                    }
                    const setWeight: (weight)=>{
                        this.weight = weight
                    }
                    const getWeight: ()=>{
                        return this.weight
                    }
            
                    //Variables
                    breed: "Shephard"
                    weight: ""
                }
            </pre>

            In Javascript the keyword `this` can be used in any context. It does not throw errors, but it can also be
            worthless to the code. 

            <h3>Objects</h3>

            THe {} denotes as object in JS. While object are declared using the keyword `const` they are mutable at any point
            in the execution of the program.

            ES6 makes thing much faster in JS. We were used to declared a object using:

            <pre>
                const name: "Me";
                const person = { name:name }
            </pre>
            now with ES6 we can simply do :
            <pre>
                const name: "Me";
                const person = { name };
            </pre>

            The keyword in when used in connection to an object (e.g <pre>'name' in Object</pre>) returns a boolean. If the 
            property name is found it will return true otherwise false.
            In Javascript it is very simple to add a new property to an Object. All we have to do is:
            <pre>person.gender = 'male'</pre>
            Objects variable are references to the memory address. This means that any clone that points to the same address in memory
            will change the value for all other variables pointing to the same address. 

            <h3>DOM</h3>

            The DOM basically represent the HTML in a web page.
            Javascript has the ability to communicate to HTML via the .document function,

            <h3>Events</h3>

            Events like DOM allow us to interact with the web page (HTML). In most cases events translate to clicks, changes, 
            mouse movements and more.
