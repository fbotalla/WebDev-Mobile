        <h3>Window object</h3>
        <p>

            The window object is basically a class with various properties and methods. These properties
            and method encapsule the information regarding the web windows we are operating on.
            For my senior project I have been working with React Native which utilizes Javascript to 
            map the logic of the operations. Because React Native does not operate in the browser, the object 
            'window' is pointless. I am sharing this to illustrate that windows only operates within specific web
            environments.

            A few common and used method for window are the following:

            <pre>
                <code>
                    window.alert('This is pausing the execution of the program and displays a message') <br>
                    window.confirm('This also pauses the program and prompts the user continuing  ') <br>
                    window.prompt('Also pauses the program and prompts the user for input')  <br>
                </code>
            </pre>

            A few other interesting methods and properties of window are some that return the information
            regarind the browser being used, the location of the URL, the protocol of the location (http, https, etc..),
            the port number (if stated in the URL). <br>

            Other methods include the reload() method, which forces the reload of the page, assign() which loads another resources from URL

            The document object is a sub object to the window. Because of this object we can begin utilizing cookies. 

            <br>
            On a different topic when we deal with browsers, windows and Javascript we always come across Cookies. Cookies simply
            are small sized files that store information regarding previous visits to the site made by users.

            <br>
            To create a cookie on a windows document object we can simply do 
            <pre>
                <code>
                    document.cookie = 'value=some string'
                </code>
            </pre>
            now, if we do the above again we are going to overwrite the cookie.
            
            If we were to do the following:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    document.cookie = 'name=some string'
                </code>
            </pre>
            By so doing we would simply add a new cookie to the cookie jar. Note the value= bs the name=.
            With cookies we can also set expiration times so that they self delete. 

            <pre>
                <code>
                    document.cookie = 'name=some string; max-age=timeInSeconds'
                </code>
            </pre>

            <br><br>

            <h3>HTML5 & APIs</h3>

            HTML5 has given to the HTML markup language more flexibility and more integration
            with its partner Javascript. With HTML we have now a series of attributes that we can give
            to our html tags. One of these is the data attribute. 
            <br>
            HTML5 has also introduced us to the localStorage API which store data using a key value pair 
            combination. 
            <br>
            HTML5 has also introduced the Web Workers API. With webworkers we can maitained the working status
            of the program while complex computation are taking place in the background.
            One interesting thing about Web Workers is that with them we can even use the program in 
            offline mode and still maintain many of the online features. 
            <br>
            HTML5 also introduced Websockets. These web sockets allow for continual communicaiton
            between parties.
            <br>
            HTML5 has introduced a lot more very useful APIs that have shaped and changed the power of simple HTML 
            <br><br>

            In conclusion, most browsers support HTML5 and its new features. They are constantly used and have made HTML 
            a more dynamic and productive markup languange.
