        <h3>Tesing and Debugging</h3>
        <p>
            In my experience I have seen how important testing and debugging. In many development methodologies testing come before writing the actual functions.
            This is also known as <b>Test-driven Development</b> or <b>TDD</b>. The idea behind TDD is that the developer writes the test and then write functions
            that are meant to pass the written test. This process definitely adds a certain level of complexity as well as time, but in the long run, the product
            will be one a robust one. Whether or not the TDD process is utilized, a developer should always test the non-trivial code. This will increase condifence
            in deploying a well complete product. Tests can also be run using third party libraries.

            Debugging on the other is the process to find certain bugs in the written code. These bugs come in many different forms. Often they are simple typos that
            the developer made while writing. Other times the logic is faulty. As there are many different bugs we also have many different ways to debug a JS program.
            A very used and useful way to do is by using the console or terminal. Web browsers have a console integrated in which we can check for expected values. An 
            exemple of using the console would be:

            <pre>console.log(Here we would want to pass a variable to check for its value. We can also pass other things like objects and much more)</pre>

            When we do so, the program will execute the console.log() function in the console of the browser or the terminal of the JS project.
            As mentioned before this is a very popular way to debug programs. Because JavaScript is a very forgiving language we want to use console.log() as much
            as possible so that we can ensure that our logic is valid and that expected values are actually correct. 
            Another common way to check for expected values without crashing the code is to use a try catch statement. This is very simple to use.
            an example of this would be:

            <pre>
                try{
                    if(x > 1) throw 'bigger';
                    if(x < 1) throw 'smaller';
                }catch(err){
                    console.log(err)
                }
            </pre>
            basically within the try brackets we want to place the code to try out. If that fails the catch statement is fired and it typically would display
            the error message associated to the try statement that failed. Even though it might seem similar to an if else statement, the try catch is quite
            different. The program will never crash if something in the try statement evaluates faulty.
