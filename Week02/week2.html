        Functions: There is a big differentece beween referencing a function and calling a function.<br>
        The way we call a function is by using the () parenthesiss at the end of the function name or variable name<br>
        If this is not done, the result is going to be a simple reference to the function. This is basically the concept<br>
        of a pointer. 
        Here is an exmaple:
        <pre>
        const testFunction = () =>{
             console.log("Hello world!");
        }
        </pre>
        <br>
        <pre>
        const pnter = testFunction; //The result here is as  simple reference to the anonymous function
        pnter() // this is going to console log "Hello world!"
        </pre>
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre>
        const testFunction = (...values) =>{} // this accepts any number of arguments and puts them in an array of values. </pre><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Callbacks are one of the strenght of javaScript. They are heavily relied upon because of the ability<br>
        that the developer has to run a certain code in repsonse to a certain event with a certain parameter.<br>
        Currently I am working on my Senior Project and I rely heavily on callback to architecture my logic.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        There are many ways to loop through an array in JavaScript. One that interested me especially was the .map(). This is <br>
        systematically different from other ways of looping because .map() takes a callabck function as a parameter. This means<br>
        that for each element in result of the loop, the callback is called on that value.<br>
        <br>
        The spread operator ... becomes very useful when I want to work with an array, but I dont not want to rewrite<br>
        it's content each time something is added or deleted. This spread operator ... makes the array very dynamical and useful<br>
        especilyl when queryin from APIs or Databases. <br>
        <br>
        The date structure SET is very useful when we don not want to have any duplicate whatsoever. In the background of a set,<br>
        the set checks for the value attempted to be inserted against all the values currently in the set. If this return true (meaning there is a match)<br>
        then the adding operation is complely ignored.<br>
        <br>
        The nice thing about Logic in programming languages is that it does not change. The syntax might, but the logic will not.<br>
        Therefore the concept of looping and coditional statements remains the same across all programming lanauges, you basically only need to learn it once.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Questions:
        <ol>
            <li>Can a callback function be an await function?</li>
            <li>When exactly would it be more convenient to use a callback over a function with some result parameters passed in it?</li>
        </ol>
