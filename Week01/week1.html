        <p>Notes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is essential to think big but code for small. Always design for mobile devices!</li>
            <li>When designing, only focus on two things:
                <ul>
                    <li>The user</li>
                    <li>What information must be prompty available</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Carefully think which areas of a mobile devices are the most clicked, place the main components there</li>
            <li>No visitor likes ads, place them well!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Questions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Is the only money the only reason why webistes have ads? Or is there more to it?</li>
            <li>Design vs Functionality, which should come first?</li>
        </ol>
