        <h3>More on Functions</h3>
        <p>This week we learned more on functional expressions. One thing that stood out to me this week was this example
            <pre>function party(){
                console.log('Wow this is amazing!');
                party = function(){
                    console.log('Been there, got the T-Shirt');
                }
            }</pre>
        Basically here this simple, but interesting concept is happening. When the party() function is called
        We first get the first console.log message. It then redefines itself. This is pretty interesting because when we 
        call the party() function once more and forever after we get the second console.log to show up.

        The other interesting scenario that goes along this is withing this simple line of code: 

        <pre>const beachParty = party</pre>

        Now, one might assume that the first time we call beachParty() we will get the first console.log to fire. 
        This is a correct asusmption. We might go further into saying that the second time and forever after time
        we call the beachParty() function we will get the second console.log to fire. This is incorrect.
        beachParty() will continue to fire the first console.log() because it was initialized with the party function
        without it being fired.
        Now the party() will act a little dirrently than expected also. If we were to call it before the beachParty()
        function then we would get the first console.log() to fire. After that call we would get the second console.log()
        to fire. If we call beachParty() and then party(), then party() will fire the second console.log().
        I found this to be a very interesting concept.

        The other topic that was discussed and that is quite interesting to me is the callback
        Javascript can get quite complex because of the many callback functions used. When we have lots of callback
        function one after the other we call that Spaghetti Code.
        The idea behind the callback is that we can pass a function as a paramenter to another function. THe function
        receiving the parameter would then call the callback function within itself. When this is done, the callback
        fires before the end of execution of the first function. THis is convenient because we can use the results of our
        callback in our original function.

        Along with functions come the async and await functionality. This is commonly used to make codes asyncrounous.
        an example of this would be such:

        <pre>async() => {
            const ref = await //some function that has a return value here
            console.log(ref);
            }</pre>

        Basically here we have an async function. If we did not have the await keyword in from of our function we would get 
        undefined displayed on the console. Instead, because of our await keyword, the code below will not be executed
        until the ref is being populated by whatever retun value our function has. Pretty cool. 


        <h3>AJAX</h3>

        To keep it simple, AJAX are requests made to the server that return data. The data returned is typically returned in an XML format 
        or JSON format. JS was designed to be a front end language. It can communicate to the server using AJAX.
        The basic usage for JS to make an AJAX call is by using the fetch() function. 
        example: 

        <pre>
            fetch(//some url).then((response)=>{
                console.log(response)
            })
        </pre>

        Basically here we make a request to an url. Then and only then (meaning after the request has been made) we use the response and
        we print it on the console. To this simple function we could add a way to make sure that the fetch() request was successful
        and we could also add a way to check that the response is also ok. There are many other things we could add to this. 

        With AJAX we can also send data to the server. For example when we use a form from an HTML page, we can send it back to server
        using AJAX.
